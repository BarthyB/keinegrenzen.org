# keinegrenzen.org

keinegrenzen.org is a german platform, where selected underground musicians and bands of all
genres can contribute one or multiple albums, EPs or Mixtapes, available for free on the website.
People who download the music can thank the artists by making donations to Doctors Without Borders.

## Philosophy

The project started as a simple website for my first music album. Since then,
it has grown in all directions: more artists participate, more people are involved,
we produce videos and plan concerts and events.
The philosophy behind all of it has never changed: good things from good people for a good cause.
Therefore, it is only logical to make the website an open source project and to actively encourage
contributions of all kinds.

## The Website

The website features:
 
- A homepage with a listing of all participating artists/bands
- Individual profiles for each artist/band
  - Contributed albums, which can be downloaded
  - A music player that streams the albums via SoundCloud
- A CMS backend to manage and create artists, albums and to keep track of the donations
- The usual imprint and tos/copyright pages

The website is based on the following frameworks and languages:

### Frameworks:
- Symfony 3.3.13
- Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta

### Languages
- PHP 5.6
- ECMAScript 6
- SCSS
